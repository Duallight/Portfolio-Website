            <div class="about-me-body">
                <p>Ever since I was little, I've found computers and related technology fascinating. When I reached the 7th grade, I finally saved up
                    enough to build my first computer. It was pretty low-end, but it's what started me on my software development journey. I started by
                    installing Ubuntu on it, and began learning the command line. I started off fine, but as I tried more and more advance commands, 
                    I ended up bricking my Ubuntu install. In doing so, however, I learned a lot about how linux works. And it was nothing a quick 
                    reinstall wouldn't fix anyways.
                </p>
                <p>Funnily enough, my first programming experience didn't even happen on a normal computer. My first program was actually on my TI-84 
                    calculator I used for math classes. It was still a simple "hello world!" program, but it lead to a lot more. Before I knew it, I had 
                    lots of little programs made to make my homework easier. Anything from a quadratic equation solver to a polynomial factoring program. 
                </p>
                <p>After discovering the joy's of programming on a basic calculator, I signed up for the beginners programming class in high school. 
                    We started using Scratch, a simple drag and drop programming language. It made understanding the flow of the program very easy, 
                    but was very limiting. Afterwards, we started using java. Honestly, I don't even remember what we programmed in java. All 
                    I remember was the joy of finally solving a problem after hours of struggle. That's actually the when I discovered that I 
                    wanted to be a software developer. All because I loved the feeling of finding the solution after lots of hardwork. While that 
                    beginners class was all my highschool offered, I continued my journey after getting accepted into UT Dallas' Computer Science
                    program, where I was able to grow with piers who shared the same passion for programming.
